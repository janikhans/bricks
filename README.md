<h1>The Brick Game</h1>

<p>Just a little game to practice Javascript with. Basically bouncing balls off of bricks and then then moving the platform to bounce it back. It's an old game, I can't remember the name of it right now though....</p>

<p>This was a tutorial by Mozilla Developer. I have changed a few things and played around with it. Maybe I'll even market it!?! It's that groundbreaking. </p>
